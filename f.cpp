/*f) What is dot product and cross product? Explain use cases of where dot product is used and cross 
product is used in graphics environment. Add links to places where you studied this information and get 
back with the understanding. 
The dot product and cross product are mathematical operations commonly used in the field of computer 
graphics to manipulate vectors. 
The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors 
and returns a scalar value. The dot product is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of 
each vector and summing the results. Geometrically, the dot product represents the cosine of the angle 
between two vectors. The dot product is used to calculate the projection of one vector onto another, to 
test whether two vectors are perpendicular, and to calculate the angle between two vectors. In graphics, 
the dot product is used to calculate lighting in 3D scenes, which is critical for creating realistic-looking 
images. 
The cross product, also known as the vector product, is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors 
and returns a third vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. The cross product is calculated by 
taking the determinant of a matrix composed of the input vectors and their basis vectors. Geometrically, 
the cross product represents the area of the parallelogram defined by two vectors, as well as the 
direction of the resulting vector, which is determined by the right-hand rule. In graphics, the cross 
product is used to calculate surface normals, which are used to determine the angle at which light 
reflects off of a surface. 
Both the dot product and cross product are fundamental operations in linear algebra, and they are used 
in many other fields in addition to computer graphics, such as physics, engineering, and computer vision.
